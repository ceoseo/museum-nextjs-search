# mext-elastic-museum-search

Powerful services & frameworks like [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) make it possible for museums to easily build performant, responsive and accessible faceted searches for their online collections.

## Dataset

All data was collected via the [Brooklyn Museum Open API](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/docs).

## Next.js template

Based on https://github.com/shadcn/next-template ([Website](https://template.shadcn.com/), [UI Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/)), 
which is an implementation of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and other helpful utilities.

## Adopt it yourself

It's hoped that all one will need to do is be able to export TMS data to JSON matching the format of the Elasticsearch index.
