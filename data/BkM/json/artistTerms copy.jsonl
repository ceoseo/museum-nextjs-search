His intense use of color and mysterious themes are distinctly Romantic. Ryder moved with his family from New Bedford, Massachusetts to New York in 187, where he studied briefly at the New York National Academy of Design. He studied the engravings of Camille Corot and other Barbizon painters, and adapted theri tonal pallettes and fine lines in his work. He traveled to Europe extensively from 1877-1896, where he studied the art collection of Spain, Italy, The Netherlands, and France. Around 1880, Ryder moved from pastoral themes to explore subjects of literary, biblical, and Wagnerian themes. Although his work is similar to that of the Symbolists, he avoided that movement's passion for eroticism and decay. Ryder combines his interest in landscapes with his passion for romantic and literary themes in is one of his best known works, \"Toilers of the Sea\" (1884), inspired by the Victor Hugo novel of the same name. Ten of his works were shown in the Armory Show of 1913. Comment on works: genre"}

During the American Revolution, Stuart lived in London where he worked in the studio of Benjamin West from 1777-1782. Combining lessons he learned from West and the work of Reynolds and Gainsborough, he gained recognition with his full length work, \"The Skater\" from 1782. Beginning in 1794, Stuart began to work on his famous portraits of Geroge Washington: \"The Vaughn Portrait\" (1794-95), reproduced on the dollar bill, \"The Athenaeum Portrait\" (1796), and the full-length \"Landsdowne Portrait\" also of 1796.

He was a leading figure of Abstract Expressionism. His style strongly influenced art after World War II. De Kooning attended the Rotterdam Academy of Fine Arts and Techniques and was drawn to Cubism. He moved to the United States in 1926 and worked as a house painter. He was influenced by many avant-garde artists at this time and began to experiment with different painting techniques and processes. He became close friends with Arshile Gorky, whose death in 1948 deeply affected him. He turned to dark and violent paintings, which evolved into an obsession with the human figure. In 1952, de Kooning created the Women series, paintings of the female body in abstract and loosely rendered form."}

In 1900, Hopper studied portrait and still-life painting with William Merritt Chase, but he preferred to take classes with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Robert Henri. In 1906, Hopper worked as a part-time illustrator, but by autumn of that year he went to Paris to study the work of European artists. His painting from this period and soon after reflects the influence of \"plein air\" painting and Impressionism. Hopper continued to work as an illustrator, garnering more critical and commercial success with it than painting, although he loathed this work. By 1925, Hopper began to develop his signature, where the focus is on only one or two solitary figures often consumed by vast outdoors spaces or cramped city streets. His landscapes also evoke a similar haunting loneliness. One of Hopper's most well known works is a poignant portrayal of urban alienation, \"The Night Hawks\" (1942). With the emergence of Abstract Expressionism in the 1940s, Hopper's work was seen as illustrative and obsolete. Pop Art and PhotoComment on works: realism resurrected his reputation. American artist.

Segal's early work is often treated within the framework of Pop Art, because of the reference to the individual's position within mass culture and the examination of the relationship between fine and popular art. Later his work reflected social concerns. These works consist of plaster molds cast from living models in order to capture life like gestures, placed in environmental tableaux, which lock them in time.

His method of composition for the original oil paintings that were the basis of the printed covers, was to make a loose sketch of the idea, then gather costumes, models, and props, make individual drawings of the parts, and then combine them into the final detailed work. Although his work had a great influence on creating an image of middle-class, conservative America, his work for \"Look\" magazine in the 1960's pursued subjects of that conflict-ridden decade, such as segregation. Throughout his long career, his work provides an excellent look into America's changing consciousness in the 20th century. Comment on works: genre"}

While accepted at Salons from 1831-1835, as his work grew more non-Academic he was continually rejected from Salons until the 1850s (giving him the nickname 'le grande refuse'), even while acquiring a strong following of disciples which included Jean-François Millet and Narcisse Diaz.

Allston's paintings are noted for their brilliant sunlight and strikingly transparent color achieved with a Venetian method of glazing he learnt while studying in London. Early works include some noteworthy portraits (e.g. Self-Portrait, 1805, and Portrait of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 1806) and historic landscapes, with \"Diana and her Nymphs in the Chase\" (1805) being his first critical success. Biblical themes next captured his interest; \"Dead Man Restored to Life by Touching the Bones of the Prophet Elisha\" (1811-1814) is indicative of his unique choices of subject matter, of his dramatic and mysterious Romantic style, and of the contemporary interest in bolstering religious faith by historical analogy. His later works were more lyrical; the peaceful and poetic \"Moonlit Landscape\" of 1819 is in essence about the human spirit expanding in the spacious quiet of nature. These later paintings mark him as a forerunner of the visionary and subjective trend in landscape painting in America. Allston's writings include poetry, a Gothic novel entitled \"Monaldi\" (1841), and his \"Lectures of Art,\" posthumously published in 1850."}

His mature works were made employing combs, laminations, rakes, and squeegees to apply acrylic paint to canvas. His late works were made using chips of acrylic paint to build mosaic-like surfaces. Whitten's sculptures which he first created in New York and later at his summer home on Crete, consist of carved wood, found objects and materials  including bone, marble, paper, glass, nails, and fishing line.

A steelworker for thirty years, Thornton Dial created painted objects for much of his life before turning to works on canvases in 1987. A self-taught folk artist, Dial built up different mediums on his canvases, and he depicted a mix of human and animal forms. Throughout his works, Dial referenced moments in Black history such as the middle passage and the Los Angeles riots of 1992."}

He was associated with the international development of Symbolism during the 1890s and recognized as a major influence on Expressionism. His early work was conventionally naturalistic; by 1884, he belonged to the avant-garde circle of the painter Christian Krøhg. During stays in Paris between 1889 and1892 Munch was influenced by the symbolists, van Gogh, and, above all, Gauguin; it was during this time that he established his characteristic nervous linear style. An exhibition of more than 50 of Munch's work at the Berlin Kunstlerverein (Artists' Union) in 1892 was so scandalous that it was closed after a week with the repercussions leading to the formation of the Berlin Sezession in 1899. Much of the next ten years was spent in Berlin associating with writers such as Richard Dehmel and August Strindberg and creating works featuring his recurrent themes of sexual awareness, illness, jealousy, and insanity. These intense and disturbing works reflected not only Symbolist preoccupations but Munch's difficulties stemming from his own traumatic childhood during which his mother and sister died and his father nearly went mad. While in Berlin he produced his first prints, with lithographs and woodcuts becoming equally important to his paintings. In 1908, he suffered a nervous breakdown and in 1909 he returned permanently to Norway, deliberately abandoning his disturbing themes as part of his recovery. His work became more outgoing, his palette brighter, and his themes more optimistic although his self-portraits retained their earlier intensity.  After 1916 Munch became increasingly reclusive and his work regained some of its earlier urgency. He lived at Ekely outside Oslo; when he died he left over 20,000 works to the city. During Munch's lifetime there were many exhibitions of his work in Oslo, Prague, Stockholm, and German cities.  Comment on works: psychological Landscapes, genre"}

He began teaching at Rutgers University in 1960, and by 1961, he had created his first paintings of cartoon and comic strip icons with his trademark use of Benday dots. By 1964, Lichtenstein was one of Pop art's most recognized, yet controversial, artists. "}

Early in his career, he was a successful commercial artist and illustrator, and his work was published in magazines and a variety of print media. In the 1960s, he helped launch the Pop movement with his silkscreened paintings of soup cans, Coca-Cola bottles, celebrities, and comic strips, as well as his prints and sculptures of common objects and household products. His studio, known as the Factory, became a magnet for extreme personalities, and he began shooting films there ca. 1963. In 1965 he announced that he would give up painting for filmmaking, though he continued to produce paintings and prints. His films tested the notion of endurance, 'Sleep' and 'Empire' lasting 5 and 8 hours, respectively. His filmed portraits were often static images of a single subject prolonged over the length of a single reel of film. Warhol embraced media of all kinds, producing experimental books, video works, and multiples. In 1966 and 1967 together with the Velvet Underground he produced the Exploding Plastic Inevitable, a series of multimedia events, as well as an album. He survived an assassination attempt in 1968. During the 1970s he focussed on commissioned portraits, and also founded the magazine 'Interview,' which continues to be published. He is considered by many to be one of the most influential artists of the late 20th century."}

He was sent to study painting in Rome by Shah Abbas II (reigned 1642-1666), but because he converted to Christianity, Zaman was forced to take refuge in the court of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. His signature is found on no fewer than 40 works. They include a number of pen boxes, papier-mâche articles (1659-1674), and his notable Night Scene mounted in the Davis Album. The influence of European art is reflected in his use of perspective, modelling with colors, and certain landscape elements. A higher level of eclecticism can be seen in five of his paintings (completed between 1682 and 1689) based on Flemish and Italian prints."}

Born in the small city of Grasse, France to a family of shopkeepers and glove-makers, Fragonard moved to Paris with his family in 1738. While still in his teens, he apprenticed to Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin for just six months and then worked in François Boucher's studio. He won the Prix de Rome in 1752, then spent three preparatory years under Carle Vanloo before studying at the Académie de France in Rome from 1756 to 1761. Fragonard also drew landscapes with Hubert Robert and traveled to southern Italy and Venice. Fragonard's submission to the Salon of 1765 earned him associate academy membership, yet he opted out of an official career of history painting. Preferring to make lighthearted, erotic pictures for private clients, he only exhibited at the Salon twice. He is known for cheerful scenes and lightning brush strokes which reinvigorated the Rococo style. He painted mythology, gallantry, landscape, and portraiture and drew in wide-ranging media, often signing his works \"Frago.\" The French Revolution ended Fragonard's career and made him a pauper. Admiring his work, the Neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David attempted to assist by making him curator of the future Musée du Louvre. Unable to adapt to the new style of painting, however, Fragonard died forgotten in Napoleon's France.  Comment on works: Landscapes; Portraits"}

He is known to have painted at least ten full-size oil paintings of the Qajar king of Fath 'Ali Shah (reigned 1797-1834). One of the early portraits was a gift to amirs of Sind (1800). Another two were painted for the Hall of the Marble Throne in the Gulistan Palace and for Versailles (a gift to Napoleon). More hang in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, but Mihr 'Ali's finest work, which perhaps represents the finest Iranian painting, is in the Nigaristan Museum in Tehrān. In this painting, Fath 'Ali Shah is depicted wearing a robe of gold brocade with a huge crown and jewels. He is known to have produced portraits of women and the ancient Persian kings. His last work is a watercolor of a man's head dated 1829."}

After working in various practices, he opened Frank O. Gehry and Associates, Inc. in 1962, where her remains as Design Principal. His early work, such as his own Gehry House (1979), shows a deconstructionist approach, taking an older building and re-assembling it with apparently casually placed low-cost corrugated metal panels, steel poles, and a canopy of wire mesh fencing. Since the 1980s, Gehry’s work has focused on the use of shiny metallic surfaces, emphasizing curving lines and the play of light and shade. The best examples are the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain (1997) and the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles (2003). In design, his approach is similar to his architecture, where disposable materials such as cardboard are used to make chairs with undulating forms that suggest elements in nature."}

Some of his portraits were excavated at Er-Rubayat in the Fayum. As with most ancient artists, the true name of the Brooklyn Painter is unknown and his work is identified only by stylistic traits. The Brooklyn Painter takes his name from the portrait of a man in the Brooklyn Museum. "}

Steichen was apprenticed to a Milwaukee, Wisconsin lithographer from 1894-1898. His interest in photography began in 1895, and during subsequent years, he exhibited in various photographic exhibitions in the United States and Europe. His early style reflects his training as a painter, using soft tonality and lighting on his subjects. In 1900, Steichen became a naturalized American citizen, and in 1901 he was elected a member of the Linked Ring, a pictorialist society in London, England, United Kingdom. In 1902, Steichen was a founding member of the Photo-Secession Movement, along with Alfred Stieglitz. In 1905, Steichen and Stieglitz opened the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession \"291\" on Fifth Avenue in New York City, New York. From 1906 to 1914, Steichen was working as a freelance painter and photographer in Paris, France, but returned to the United States on the eve of World War I with the desire to become a photojournalist in the tradition of Matthew Brady. From 1914 to 1919, Steichen was an aerial reconnaissance photographer and director of photographic services for the United States Air Force. In 1920 Steichen abandoned painting completely for photography and from 1923 to 1938, Steichen had a studio in New York City, New York. He also worked as the chief photographer for Vogue magazine, creating such iconic fashion images as his portrait of Gloria Swanson behind a black lace veil. He became a Lieutenant Commander in United States Navy in 1942 and he organized the War Photography Department. From 1945 to 1946, Steichen was the director of the Naval Photographic Institute organizing two exhibitions for MOMA: \"Road to Victory\" (1942), a photographic portrait of The United States on which he collaborated with his brother-in-law, poet Carl Sandburg, and \"Power In The Pacific\"(1945). Steichen abandoned his own photography practice in 1947 to become the director of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art, New York City, New York. He held this position until 1962. He died on March 25, 1973."}

At the age of eleven, he was awarded a fellowship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, and went on to the California School of Fine Arts in 1932. He received his BA in philosophy from Stanford University in 1936. Motherwell began his career as a painter in 1939 in Paris, where he had his first solo exhibition, and studied art history from 1940 to 1941 at Columbia University in New York. There he met Roberto Matta, Meyer Schapiro, and other exiled European artists associated with Surrealism. Emotionally charged brushwork and severely structured abstract were painted during this period, but in 1943, Motherwell produced a series of dark, menacing works in Response to World War II. The work for which he is best known, the series \"Elegy to the Spanish Republic XXXIV\" (1953-1954), are large abstracts that reflect his generation's despair at the lost cause of the Spanish Civil War. During the 1950s, Motherwell spent most of his time lecturing and teaching, notably at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. It was during this time he worked on his most influential literary achievement, \"The Dada Painters and Poets: An Anthology\" (New York, 1951). In 1952, Motherwell and Ad Reinhardt produced the journal \"Modern Artists in America.\" Motherwell and Helen Frankenthaler were married from 1958 to 1971. From 1968 to 1972, Mortherwell worked on a series of paintings called \"Open,\" which reflected the new style of color field painting. His later works returned to more traditional Abstract Expressionist vocabulary. "}

Little is known of him or his career, therefore his corpus of works has been established on the basis of stylistic criteria, but its exact chronology is uncertain. The earliest known work attributed to Fouquet is the painted portrait, now in Vienna; it dates from ca. 1440, the date having been confirmed by dendrochronological analysis. Fouquet is documented in Rome between 1446 and 1448. He was apparently not active after 1479, and he is known to have been dead by 8 November 1481."}

Three years later, Houdon obtained a residency at the Académie de France in Rome, and in Italy, he discovered the newly uncovered works at Herculaneum and Pompeii as well as works of the Renaissance sculptors, especially Michelangelo. A year after his return to Paris in 1768, Houdon was received into the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. In 1771, Houdon became a member of the Académie, presenting his marble 'Morpheus' as his reception piece; Houdon was named professor at the Académie in 1778. Throughout his career, he moved easily between a style of controlled classicism and a baroque dynamism, adapting the treatment to the nature of the subject. His work also displays a rigorous realism, inspired by quattrocentro sculpture and based on in-depth anatomical studies. His sense of classical restraint coupled with an incisive understanding of and ability to depict human character give Houdon's portraits their particular vitality and reflective expression.

During the 1930s he lived in poverty and worked as a mural assistant for the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. His work before 1938 shows the influence of Benton, Albert Pinkham Ryder, and the Mexican muralists. In 1938, he was hospitalized for alcoholism during which time he used automatic drawing as therapy. From this, Pollock developed his early style, one of totemic male and female figures and images of eyes or mythic beasts that constituted a personal iconography.  A fine example of this period is \"Guardians of the Secret,\" a work of late-Surrealist style and frenetic brushwork that would hint at his later mature style. He met the painter Lee Krasner in 1941, and they married in 1945. Pollock is best known for working methods of pouring or dripping paint onto a large canvas on the floor, moving about it as he worked, the entire art process being a kind of performance. Typically moving from left to right as if \"writing\" the work, Pollock laid the key vertical and horizontal elements down first, mostly black or white, and then intertwined subsequent colors within it. This method of organizing a space into panels echoes Benton's theories of mural composition. Pollock was one of the first celebrity painters of the Post-War era in the USA, his free-form style and dramatic personality capturing the spirit of the Beat Generation of the early 1950s. He was killed in a car accident in 1956. Comment on works: painter"}

Between 1953 and 1957, he studied at the Bradford School of Art, producing portraits and observations of his surroundings. He began his post-doctorate studies at the Royal College of Art London in 1959, where he turned first to the discipline of drawing from life. Throughout his career, the human figure would prove to be Hockney's preferred subject matter. During the 1960s, Hockney developed his own personal vision of Pop Art, interjecting playful and ironic elements. In his swimming pool pictures, Hockney juxtaposes accurate renditions of the human form with abstract renditions of water. His photographic work remained unknown to the public until the 1980s, which were then exhibited worldwide. In these works he creates collages of images taken with a Polaroid SX 70 using a cubist idiom. Time, picture surface, repetition, and shifting planes characterize these works.     "}

He is regarded as one of the most innovative printmakers of the 20th century, particularly in regard to his development of intaglio and color printmaking techniques, on which he published guides.  Born to a family of artists, he studied chemistry and geology and worked in the Middle East from 1922-1925 for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but decided to abandon this career for art. He settled in Paris in 1926 and in 1927 he founded a print shop in Paris with Joseph Hecht. The shop became known as Atelier 17, (called Atelier Contrepoint after Hayter's death in 1988). He worked there with many artists of the time, including Miró, Arp, Tanguy, Giacometti, Matta, Brauner, Kandinsky, Alechinsky, and André Masson, with whom he explored automatic drawing. Between 1933 and 1950, Hayter relocated to New York where he was in contact with other European and American painters, including Pollock, Rothko, Motherwell, and Gorky."}

He began his career as a musician and wrote his thesis at Tokyo University on Arnold Shoenberg. He continued his studies in Munich and Freiburg, and gravitated to the avant-garde music scene in Cologne and Darmstadt, where he worked with Karlheinz Stockhausen. He met John Cage and began incorporating elements of what would become performance art into musical events, which led to an involvement with the Fluxus group. He exhibited the first known art work to incorporate television sets in 1963, and is perhaps most widely known for his collaborations with Charlotte Moorman, beginning in 1965, which resulted in the creation of his \"TV Bra for Living Sculpture.\" He is credited with coining the phrase \"electronic superhighway.\" Major retrospectives of his work were held at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1982, and the Guggenheim Museum in 2000."}

He decorated a wide variety of vessels, from amphorae to cups, and favored horses and mythological scenes. His painting style is rather old-fashioned and clearly marks him as a pupil of the vase painter Exekias. He is also known to have worked with the potter Andokides. As well as his usual work, the Lysippides Painter decorated the black-figure side of several bilingual vases, vases decorated in both black- and red-figure techniques. The Andokides Painter, another vase painter working with the potter Andokides, decorated the other side of these vases in the newly invented red-figure technique. Scholars have thought that the Lysippides Painter and the Andokides Painter might be one and the same. Yet the Lysippides Painter's conventional style seems at odds with the innovative quality of the work of the Andokides Painter. As with most Greek vase painters, the real name of the Lysippides Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. He is named after a kalos inscription of the youth Lysippides on a vase now in the British Museum in London."}

She mastered the difficult wet collodion negative and albumen print process, and was later elected as a member to the photographic societies of London and Scotland in 1864. Cameron regarded the recent technical advancements of photography as an intrusion between her and her subject. She often inscribed on her work \"From Life,\" and refused to retouch defects on the negative. Her soft-focus technique gives her images a dream-like quality, often using dramatic and symbolic lighting. Her major work of narrative photography was her \"Illustrations to Tennyson's 'Idylls of the King' and Other Poems\" (London, 874-1875). "}

His most productive period was between 1880 and 1900, but he was not well known until the late 1920s. Although many of his works feature satirical fantasies, he also painted seascapes, landscapes, and still-lifes. He was self-taught in the art of copperplate etching and produced many masterful works in this medium. In both his graphical works and in his paintings he made use of the carnival masks sold in his family's shop in Ostend as models for figures in thronging crowd scenes, still lifes, and domestic tableaux. These works can be interpreted as critiques of the Catholic Church, the Belgian state, and society in general. His most well-known painting may be \"Christ's Entry into Brussels,\" a large-scale work in which the title figure is dwarfed by a crowd of grotesques. He remained in Ostend for the majority of his life, leaving in 1877 at the age of 17 to study at the Académie Royale des Beaux Arts in Brussels. Upon his return to Ostend in 1879 he established a studio above his parents' shop, where he produced the majority of his mature work. In 1883 he was a founding member of the Groupe des Vingt. During his lifetime Ensor's work was critiqued harshly by his contemporaries, even among the avant-garde group he helped found."}

Some of his most important works include the poem L’Ange Heurtebise (1925); the play Orphée (1926); and the novels Les Enfants terribles (1929) and La Machine infernale (1934). His films included Le Sang d’un poète (1930) and La Belle et la bête (1946). His early life was spent in the thrall of the theater, but around 1916 he began associating with avant-garde painters and composers. His collaboration on the ballet Parade (1917) with Picasso, Satie, and Massine evolved from his personal association with both Serge Diaghilev and Picasso, whom Cocteau greatly admired. "}

Muybridge came to the United States in 1852 where he worked as a publisher and a book-dealer. He returned to England in 1860 and began photographing. By 1867 he returned to California and sold photographic views using the pseudonym \"Helios.\" During this time, he was commissioned by Leland Stanford to study the motion of a trotting horse using photographic methods. Muybridge abandonded the experiments in 1873 while he travelled to Central America, but began them again when he returned in 1877. His experiments with capturing motion using photography became more in-depth as he designed a faster shutter and a technique for using shorter exposures. The resulting photographs allowed him to successfully analyze each individual stage of motion of a horse trotting, and the published photographs earned him a name with the public. He also performed additional experiments using multiple cameras to capture motion, and designed a projecting device for drawings derived from his photographs called a 'zoopraxiscope'. This device allowed him to illustrate how artists in the past had inaccurately represented motion in their paintings and drawings. In 1884, Muybridge began working at the University of Pennsylvania, where he continued his experiments using multiple cameras to study human and animal motion. Many of his photographs were reproduced in his landmark publication 'Animal Locomotion'. Today Muybridge's photographic innovations are considered a precursor to modern motion pictures.

He was a prominent force of Dada and Surrealism, and the only American to play a significant role in the development of those movements. His visits to Alfred Stieglitz's gallery, 291 introduced him to a wide variety of European contemporary artists, such as Picasso, Rodin, and Braque. Like many other artists of his time, he was also greatly influenced by the avant-garde Armory show in New York City in 1913. His paintings from this period show his fascination with the flatness of Modernism and his interest in the patterns of shapes rather than a realistic rendering of subject matter. During his trip to Paris in 1921, Man Ray began to experiment with photography, and may have been introduced to the photogram by Tristan Tzara. He adopted the method and called his works \"rayographs,\" photographic images composed of ordinary objects placed on photo sensitive paper exposed to light. Together with his muse Lee Miller, he developed the solarization process which he used in his fashion and nude photography. With the onset of World War II, he lived in California and concentrated on painting and making objects. He returned to Paris in 1951, where he remained until his death. Man Ray was one of the first artists to make photographs seen as important works of art, equal to that of painting and sculpture."}

Possibly Clouet worked regularly as a painter of religious or history pictures, although his works are not known today. He is held as the virtual founder of the tradition of portraiture in Renaissance France based on surviving drawings in black and red chalk.

His work had a lasting impact on contemporary tastes in architecture and the decorative arts, primarily in Britain where he was the single greatest influence on architect Robert Adam. He is best known for his dramatic series of etchings, \"Prisons,\" inspired by both his early training as a scenographer and his admiration for Roman ruins. In 1743, he published 12 plates of architectural fantasies, ideal structures, and imaginary scenes of ruins, intended to improve the state of architecture and advance the potential use of antique ruins in contemporary design. In 1744, he came in contact with the works of Tiepolo, which transformed his tight, exact early style to one of bold, fluid lines and dramatic chiaroscuro. Piranesi was in contact with practicing architects, most notably French and British throughout the 1750s, but in the 1760s, he received his first architectural and design commissions from Pope Clement XIII Rezzonico and members of his family. Although with the influence of the Rezzonico family waned with the Pope's death in 1769, Piranesi's work achieved widespread popularity throughout Europe.

Also in that year he became a member of the Seven and Five Society in 1924 and was elected president in 1926. In 1928, under the influence of Alfred Wallis, he began to paint in a primitive style. He travelled to France in 1932 and 1933 in the company of the sculptor Barbara Hepworth. There he became acquainted with Arp, Miró, Mondrian, and Calder. In 1933 both Nicholson and Hepworth were invited to join the Abstraction-Création Group in Paris.

The group is named after five hydriai with kalos inscriptions praising Leagros. The artists typically used shapes with broad surfaces that allowed large-scale compositions. There are over 400 vases attributed to them, around 200 large hydriai with flat shoulders, or neck amphorae, and various amphorae, kraters, and lekythoi. Like most contemporary artists, the Leagros group painters framed their compositions on large vases with patterned borders. They are distinctive in having abandoned the common animal frieze below the scenes on the body of hydriai and the ivy trails on the sides of the scenes, replacing them with palmettes framed in scrollwork or loops, a pattern established by the newer Red-figure style."}

Beaton was commissioned by the Ministry of Information to take photographs of London and British RAF bases during World War II.

In addition to producing books for powerful aristocrats such as Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg, Bening worked for a group of international royal patrons including Emperor Charles V and Don Fernando, the Infante of Portugal. He specialized in books of hours and is also known to have received commissions for painted genealogical tables and portable altarpieces on parchment. Bening's art continued the Flemish tradition of skillfully representing the muted natural light of haunting nocturnal scenes. His work also contributed to a newer Flemish practice of painting poetic landscape vistas. "}

He was trained in the workshop of the Berlin Painter, but set up his own workshop along with the Altamura Painter and the Blenheim Painter ca. 470 BCE. This workshop specialized in making large vases and was later taken over by his student Polygnotos. His work reflects the transition from Archaic red-figure vase painting to the Classical style. His early compositions, figures and drapery were stiff and simple but later compositions became more complex, his figures began to interact, and his drapery became softer and more substantial with increasingly sharply differentiated details. His work is noted for its careful and assured draftsmanship. His figures are tall, slender and have broad heads with idealized profiles and clearly differentiated features. The Niobid Painter followed the Berlin Painter's preferences in vase shapes and ornament, favoring kraters, neck amphorae, hydriai and pelikai. He typically decorated them with an edging of a meander interrupted by crosses in squares, with a band of lotus palmettes around the mouth and lyre palmettes and palmette trees near the handles. This ornamental decoration is noted for its varied and meticulously drawn tendrils and leaves. The Niobid Painter favored scenes of lovers pursuing each other, sacrifices, the Departure of Triptolemos and great battles involving Amazons, centaurs, giants, or Trojans. The artist also appears to have been interested in glorifying Athens, preferring the Athenian hero Theseus over the more general Greek hero Herakles. He also drew inspiration from Athens' role in the recent wars with Persia and used Triptolemos, originally an Eleusinian hero, to embody Athens' claim to be the cultural and political center of Greece. It is thought that many compositions by the Niobid Painter and his followers may reflect lost wall paintings by Polygnotos of Thasos or Mikon. The most famous (on his name vase, on the opposite side to the Killing of the Niobids) probably represents the gathering of the Athenian heroes before the Battle of Marathon; he did not use the single ground line typical in vase painting to create an illusion of depth."}

During this time he concentrated on photographing the streets of New York City. In 1894, Stieglitz travelled to Europe and was elected a member of the Linked Ring, a pictorialist society in London. In 1902, Stieglitz founded the Photo-Secession Movement which attempted to prove that pictorialist photography was a fine art form. From 1903 to 1917, Stieglitz was publisher and director of Camera Work magazine. The graphic section was run by Edward Steichen (1879-1973). In 1905, Stieglitz opened the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession \"291\" on Fifth Avenue in New York City with Steichen. The galleries operated until 1917. In 1907, Stieglitz exhibited his autochrome photographs. Stieglitz stopped photographing in 1937. During his lifetime, Stieglitz was also a close friend and collaborator of Joseph T. Keiley. Together they invented the glycerine process which permitted partial development of platinum papers. Also, they produced joint research on the history of photography. Keiley also acted as the associate editor of Stieglitz's publications \"Camera Notes\" and \"Camera Works\". American photographer."}

His father was probably the art dealer Jan Wijnants. Dirck Wijntrack was an important early influence on his work and there is evidence that the two artists worked together during the 1650s. Early paintings often feature brick farm buildings and cottages and over time the buildings became less central to the composition and were placed in the middle distance. Most of his later paintings are landscapes, particularly dunescapes based on the broad ridge of sand dunes near Haarlem. His later paintings also often include stylized foliage and a blasted elm or oak tree dominating the foreground, as in \"Hawking Party with a Falconer\" (1666). Wijnants also painting Italianate landscapes, although he never travelled to Italy himself, and he is the painter of the topographical \"View of the Herengracht, Amsterdam\" (ca. 1661). His work was very appealing to English collectors of the 18th century and influenced 18th- and 19th-century artists such as François Boucher, Thomas Gainsborough, and John Crome. "}

The Annans purchased the rights to the process and brought it to Britain. In 1887 after the death of Thomas Annan, James took over the portrait side of the business as well as direction of the photogravure printing. His brother John ran the commercial side of the business. In 1889 the firm T. & R. Annan & Sons became the photographers and photogravures to the Queen. In the 1890s Annan made prints of the negatives taken by David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson and produced photogravures from these negatives. In 1892 Annan photographed in the northern Netherlands and in 1894 he traveled to the north of Italy. Annan was elected a member of the pictorial photography group the Linked Ring, London in 1894. In 1904 Annan became the first president of the International Society of Pictorial Photographers ('Pictorial Photography in Britain'). In 1913 Annan photographed in Spain.

In the 1940s, becoming interested in expanding the range of percussive instruments, he developed the \"prepared piano\", composing works for a piano with various objects placed between the strings. After studying Zen Buddhism, Cage began to work toward a new theory of composition, focusing on removing intention and personal taste, with attention paid to the process and the element of chance. Regarding silence on equal terms as structured sound and noise, in 1952 Cage produced 4'33\", a composition in which no sound is made. Cage was a strong influence and a collaborator with many visual artists."}

In 1925, he took over the printing and advertising offices of the Bauhaus in Dessau, where he designed Bauhaus publications. Photography became his preferred mode of expression in the 1930s and his work from this period shows the influence of Surrealism. His photomontages typically show blended levels of reality and dreamlike images. He moved to New York in 1938 where he curated two Bauhaus exhibitions which toured internationally from 1967 to 1971.

It began by making simple brown stoneware and from 1787 it produced similar wares in partnership with the Leeds Pottery. It later expanded into making creamwares of excellent quality, white salt-glazed stoneware and other refined types. A manganese-brown glaze known as the 'Rockingham glaze' was developed. In addition to typical tablewares the factory also made cadogans that were later imitated by other factories. In 1825, under the proprietorship of Thomas Brameld and his brothers George Frederick and John Wager, the manufacture of porcelain began. High quality bone china was apparently made from 1826 when Earl Fitzwilliam, heir to the Rockingham estate, helped to finance the factory; after this time the griffin from his family crest was adopted as a mark. His role as patron of the manufactory is unique in the history of English ceramics. Wares of this period were mostly done in a rich Rococo style with abundant floral decoration; they were sometimes imitative of Coalport wares."}

By refusing to accept the standards and practices of the established art world, Duchamp redefined our understanding of what constitutes an art object. Duchamp was born into a family of artists, and by the age of 15, he turned to painting, executing a series of landscapes in the Impressionist style. From 1910, Duchamp emulated the structural compositions and brushstrokes of Cézanne, and used an intense color palette reminiscent of The Fauves. While living with his brother in Puteaux, a suburb of Paris, Duchamp came in contact with a host of avant-garde writers and poets, notably Léger, Apollinaire, and Kupka, and as a result his painting shifted to incorporate the fragmented style of Cubism. This exposure to Cubism, along with his interest in the photographic sequences of Eadweard Muybridge resulted in the work, \"Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2\" (1912). Duchamp tried to show the work at the Salon des Indepéndants in Paris, but the title, inscribed on the canvas, was objected to and he withdrew his submission. When it was shown at the Armory Show in New York in 1913, the work gained critical opposition and his name and reputation became forever associated with it. In 1913, Duchamp began to abandon the traditional tools and techniques of painting, attempting to elevate art and the art making process above the purely visual and commercial. During this time, he came in contact with the writing of obscure German philosopher Max Stirner, who believed that the right of an individual was to be held supreme, considered above and beyond the needs of society. It is believed that Duchamp took that notion and applied it to the art object, investigating the possibility of making works of art that were not motivated by aesthetic conditions. It was during this time that he created \"Bicycle Wheel,\" a work created from an inverted bicycle wheel mounted to the seat of a stool. This was one of the first of what he referred to as a \"ready-made,\" a work of art that is deemed so simply through the selection of the artist. In 1915, Duchamp created \"The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even\" (1915-1923) comprised of two large sheets of painted glass in two sections. The \"Bride,\" an anthropomorphic shape, is confined to he top section, and \"the bachelors,\" a composite machine made from a glider and a chocolate grinder at the bottom. The work explores themes of sexual opposition, geometry, physics, and the existing factors of chance. Accompanying the \"Glass\" was a large series of notes, to be consulted as a type of guide. During the teens and 1920s, Duchamp continued to create \"ready-mades,\" giving them ambiguous titles. From 1923-1942, excluding brief trips to the USA, he remained in France where his interest in chess became increasingly more important than creating art. He maintained a low profile in the art world, even though he participated in various Dada and Surrealist exhibitions in Paris and New York. From 1942-1968, Duchamp lived in New York. For 22 years he worked on, and kept secret, his final work, \"Etant donnés: 1 La Chute d'Eau, 2 La Gaz d' éclairage,\" a three-dimensional installation. Duchamp exerted little influence on the work of his contemporaries, but following the installation of his work in the Arensberg Collection in the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1954, he became a cult figure among the avant-garde, both in Europe and the USA. Subsequently, he has been seen as perhaps the most important figure to affect the shift towards conceptual art in the late 20th century."}

In addition to being an artist, Andre wrote poetry and was a conductor for the Pennsylvania Railroad. After 1965, his sculptures consisted mainly of 'floor pieces,' consisting of individual units of industrial materials placed directly on the floor in patterns that were inherent to the size and shape of the units themselves. In the 1970s, Andre created many large-scale installations and currently continues to emphasize placement, environment, and materials in his art. "}

In 1873 Annan's brother Robert joins the business as a partner and T. & R. Annan & Sons was formed. In 1883 Annan travelled to Vienna, Austria with his son James Craig to learn the photogravure process from its inventor Karl Klic. Annan bought the rights for this process in Britain."}

Brady invited Gardner to move from Scotland to New York City, New York to work for him at his New York gallery. From 1858 to 1863 Gardner ran Brady's Washington, D.C. gallery. At this time Gardner was using electric light to photograph. In 1863, Gardner left Brady's firm and decided to photograph the Civil War by himself. He photographed Abraham Lincoln at the Battle of Antietam. He also became the official photographer of the army of the Potomac. In 1863 Gardner opened his own studio in Washington, D.C. where he sold mainly stereographs. In 1865 Gardner did the reportage on Lincoln's assasination and funeral. In 1866 Gardner published \"Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the Civil War\". In 1867 he closed his Wahington studio and became the official photograher of the Union Pacific Railroad's Eastern Division.

Boizot began his career training under René-Michel Slodtz. He studied at the 'Académie Royale,' Paris, winning the Prix de Rome in 1762. In 1773, he was appointed artistic director of the sculpture studio at the Royal Porcelain Manufactory at Sèvres, a position he held until 1806. Boizot's style was diverse. He began his career working primarily with decorative sculpture and commissions for Fontainebleau and Louveciennes. From 1770 to 1790 Boizot was most productive, working predominantly on portrait busts, small groups, and statuettes. He is best known for his detailed portrait busts of the French royal family, which exhibit a classicism characteristic of his time.   Comment on works: Sculptor"}

There, he became court sculptor of the Medici Dukes. He was famed for compositional sophistication, sensuous, tactile treatment of human body, and sheer technical virtuosity. He was extremely influential because the Medici gave his works as diplomatic gifts and his style was thus known throughout Europe. His style also spread through his many students, who studied in Florence with him, and returned to Northern Europe. He died in Florence, Italy in 1608. Comment on works: Sculptor"}

Inspired by the works of De Chirico, in the 1920s he began to experiment with concepts of reality in his paintings, altering form and often creating entirely new objects, giving his work the mystical look of a riddle. By 1926 he became involved with the Belgian Surrealist movement, and later lived in Paris from 1927-1930, connecting with the Surrealists in that city and painting full-time. His work began exploring a disconnect between normal objects, or between text and what is shown, as with his work \"Treachery of Images\" where the image of a pipe is accompanied by the text \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\". Possibly drawing from his experience in advertising, his work employed standard human types, such as his businessman wearing a bowler hat, whose image appeared in numerous works. Magritte had been fairly well-known due to his association with the French Surrealists, but did not become an internationally recognized artist until 1948, when he signed a contract with New York dealer Alexander Iolas. He died in 1967, several days after the opening of a major retrospective of his work.  Comment on works: surreal scenes"}

Though her early work was nonobjective, after a 1975 retrospective at the Whitney Museum, Baer moved to Ireland and began work that illustrated her own concept of “radical figuration,” which included fragmentary images, some sourced from art history. She is also known as a writer who countered Donald Judd and Robert Morris's notion of Minimalism in published statements."}

In 1854 Robinson studied photography with Hugh Welch Diamond. In 1857 Robinson opened a photographic studio in Leamington, Warwick, England. Robinson began to create composite prints by using several negatives to form one coherent print. He learned this technique from Oscar G. Rejlander in 1858. In 1859 Robinson's studio begins to produce portraits in the cartes-de-visite format. In 1865 Robinson moved to London, England due to poor health and opened a private portrait studio. In 1868 Robinson moved to Tunbridge Wells, Kent and formed a partnership with N.K. Cherrill which operated until ca. 1876 at which point Cherrill left the partnership. Robinson then ran it with his son until 1888. In 1892 Robinson was a founding member of the Linked Ring, a pictorialist society, London."}

He studied at Munich's Königliche Kunstgewerbeschule with the Jugendstil poster artists Weisberger and Hohlwein, and later with Ernst Neumann, an advertising designer. The outbreak of World War I ended his studies in 1914. His earliest photo-based works involved juxtapositions of combat photographs with government war propaganda. He shared a studio with his friend, the painter George Grosz, and together they anglicized their names as a protest against the war. In 1918 he joined both the Berlin Dada movement and Germany's Communist Party. He designed book jackets for leftist literature at his brother's publishing house Malik Verlag, and from the mid-1920s his photomontages began to appear in left-wing periodicals. He is most noted for the satirical montages targeting Adolf Hitler and his followers that he created in the 1930s for the magazine AIZ (Die Arbeiter Illustrierte Zeitung)."}

From 1928 until his death he worked in the same wooden studio building in Prague, itself becoming a subject of many of his photographs. Early in his career he did advertising work, portraiture, and landscapes. From 1940 he stopped making enlargements and made only contact prints from large negatives. He lived in seclusion from the beginning of World War II, and concentrated on still lifes. He received the Czech government artists of merit award in 1961."}

He studied at Wichita University and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln where he received a BFA 1956. He also studied at Brooklyn Art School, and the University of Colorado. He was a prolific filmmaker, and was a pioneer in the use of \"found footage.\" Most of his films are constructed from images shot by others and cut to new soundtracks, including popular or underground music. His film \"Crossroads\" was made entirely with official footage shot of a hydrogen bomb test in the Bikini Atoll set to a soundtrack by Terry Riley. Many of his films are considered precursors to what would become the music video genre. In the 1960s, Conner began making highly detailed ink drawings, referred to as the Mandala Series. In the 1970s and 1980s, concurrent with his filmmaking, he would create two-dimensional collages from 18th and 19th century etchings. He created large-scale photograms of human figures, and a series of black and white photographs documenting underground music in San Francisco during the late 1970s. His later work often incorporated obsessively created inkblots on paper, made with an accordion fold technique."}

He was probably trained in Zara or Venice. As an etcher, he seems to have been essentially self-taught, working initially from drawings by Parmigianino. By the late 1530s Schiavone seems to have been established in Venice. His early work is busy and bright, but in his later career he began aiming for greater sobriety and control, and was influenced by the compositional models of Raphael and Titian. He was recognized as an important and successful artist during his lifetime."}

Noted for long, successful career and many prominent pupils, especially among the Utrecht Caravaggisti, made him one of Utrecht’s principal painters in the first half of the 17th century. During his lifetime he enjoyed high esteem for his paintings of religious and mythological subjects and for his numerous drawings. At first he worked in a Mannerist style, then in a Caravaggesque manner, finally adopting a distinctive, decorative synthesis of both approaches.

In 1901 \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\" was privately published with her own illustrations. The publication of her children's stories gave her independence from her family wealth.
