Lenapehoking: Land of the Lenape
The Brooklyn Museum stands on land that is part of the unceded, ancestral homeland of the Lenape (Delaware) people. As a sign of respect, we recognize and honor the Lenape (Delaware) Nations, their elders past and present, and future generations. We are committed to addressing exclusions and erasures of Indigenous peoples, and confronting the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism in the Museum’s work.
Our Mission
To bring people together through art and experiences that inspire celebration, compassion, courage, and the will to act.
Our Vision
To be the place where art is a powerful force for personal transformation and social change.
Our Values
Great Art and Great Art Experiences
We hold ourselves to the highest standards of excellence in collections, exhibitions, programs, and visitor experience. Our work seeks to expand and challenge the traditional art historical canon by including multiple perspectives. We strive to create opportunities for transformative engagement with our collections through inspirational exhibitions, programs, and educational offerings, and to welcome all visitors with respect.
Many Histories and a Shared Future
We promote perspectives that expand the stories we tell and engage diverse audiences in conversations that broaden the way we see ourselves, the world, and its possibilities. The Museum should be a place where people see themselves with dignity and each other with empathy, care, and respect. As a public, civic institution, we believe it is our mandate to contribute to the advancement of society with a commitment to true connectedness and diversity. Central to this belief is our commitment to exploring, understanding, and appreciating our differences, while acknowledging how structural inequities and systems of oppression impact our work.
Openness and Free Expression
We believe that the open and free exchange of ideas among people of diverse beliefs, cultures, and experiences stimulates new understandings, expands insights into our shared humanity, and promotes social generosity. We also recognize that differing views may sometimes be met with discomfort, dissent, and even conflict, and we embrace our public, civic role as an important conduit for open sharing and learning.
Action and Impact
We celebrate the cultural vibrancy of our local communities and work to help build meaningful relationships that strengthen and deepen them. Believing that through innovation and action there is hope, we champion the powerful roles art and artists can play in our communities, both inside and outside the Museum’s walls. We endeavor to bring attention to issues of social justice through our programming and partnerships, amplifying the voices of those who have been historically marginalized, and hope to inspire action and impact.
Professionalism and Passion
We seek to create a work environment that values and fosters equity, accountability, innovation, teamwork, and excellence. We are committed to creating and cultivating a diverse community of talented, passionate people who are inspired to make the Museum an important hub of community activity and a great global destination, grow their professional skills, and work collaboratively with colleagues they admire and respect. We work to incorporate anti-oppressive and anti-racist practices into all facets of the Museum and to use our resources to further these goals, including the full engagement of our Board and staff.

Anne PasternakShelby White and Leon Levy Director
Since 2015, Anne Pasternak has served as the Shelby White and Leon Levy Director of the Brooklyn Museum, one of the oldest and largest fine arts institutions in the nation. For more than thirty years, Anne has devoted her career to engaging broad audiences with the limitless power of art to move, motivate, and inspire. As a staunch advocate for the civic and democratic roles our cultural and educational institutions can play, she is committed to projects that demonstrate the crucial links between art and social justice.During her time at the Brooklyn Museum, Anne has focused on strengthening the Museum as a center for the visual arts that is courageous, pioneering, and inspirational. With her demonstrated imagination and skill, she envisions new ways to connect the Brooklyn Museum’s historical collections with contemporary ideas and practices, such as experimenting with how to make the permanent collection and gallery spaces into more dynamic experiences. Through her leadership, Anne has also expanded the Museum’s educational and public program offerings, and she has fostered remarkable special exhibitions, including The Legacy of Lynching: Confronting Racial Terror in America and We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women, 1965–85. These initiatives are building the foundations for the Brooklyn Museum’s new Strategic Plan, to further the Museum’s mission to create inspiring encounters with art and engage the community around the issues of today.Prior to joining the Brooklyn Museum, Anne served as the director of Creative Time, where she initiated projects that gave artists opportunities to respond to political and environmental challenges, while also expanding their practice and work globally. During her tenure, the organization collaborated with hundreds of artists, including Nick Cave, Paul Chan, Jenny Holzer, and Kara Walker, commissioning and presenting works that ranged from sculptural installations in Grand Central Station’s Vanderbilt Hall to skywriting over Manhattan, as well as Tribute in Light, the twin beacons of light that illuminated the sky above the former World Trade Center site, and continue to be presented on the anniversaries of 9/11.

About the Museum
Is the Museum a private or public institution?The Brooklyn Museum is a private, nonprofit institution governed by a Board of Trustees, operating in a building owned by New York City.
How large is the Museum and its collections?The Brooklyn Museum is one of the largest art museums in the United States and one of the premier art institutions in the world. Our collections include a wide range of objects, from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture in the world. We are housed in a 560,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts building.
What is meant by the term “collections”?Our collections are made up of the works of art that the Museum actually owns. (It does not include works in special exhibitions or works temporarily on loan to the Museum.) The collections range from Egyptian sarcophagi to period rooms, with only a fraction of these works on display at any given time. Collections are rotated (that is, some objects are put away so that others can be shown) in the collection galleries, but there are always many works in our storerooms.
What is in the Museum’s collections?Our world-renowned collections range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art and represent a wide range of cultures. All collections can be explored on our website.
Why are some objects not on view?The collections are very large, which is why only a fraction of them can be on public view at any given time. Sometimes, works are lent to other museums for special exhibitions; sometimes, they are in our conservation laboratory for study or maintenance. Certain types of objects, such as watercolors, textiles, and photographs, are sensitive to light and begin to fade if they are exposed for too long, so their exhibition time is limited. Finally, as large as the Museum is, there is not enough room to display everything in the collections. In order to present our best works, collections are rotated periodically.
What is meant by the term “special exhibition”?A special exhibition is a temporary installation of artworks devoted to a particular theme. Special exhibitions may include works from our collections but usually feature works that are borrowed from museums around the country or around the world. Sometimes a special exhibition will show works that belong to just one institution or owner. Special exhibitions are usually on view for about twelve weeks and often travel to other museums before or after being shown at the Brooklyn Museum.
What are the current special exhibitions at the Museum?Visit our On View page.
 
Artworks and Appraisals
I’m an artist. How can I let you know about my work?Please email BKM.Collections@brooklynmuseum.org to share your work with the Brooklyn Museum.
How can I donate a work of art to the Museum?Since its founding, the Brooklyn Museum has benefited from the public’s generosity in building our collections, and we continue to welcome gifts. However, not every object is right for our collections. If we already have an identical work, or if a work would not be exhibited, we prefer not to add it to the collection. Therefore, we have a careful process for reviewing all gift offers.
If you wish to offer an artwork to the Museum, please send images, object information (such as the artist, title, dimensions, medium, history, and provenance), and a letter outlining your intentions to BKM.Collections@brooklynmuseum.org. We appreciate your generosity.
How do I find out how much an object in the Brooklyn Museum collections is worth?We do not disclose the monetary value of objects in our collections. These works are not for sale, and we do not have or keep values for them.
Can you tell me the value of an artwork that I own?As a nonprofit institution, the Brooklyn Museum does not provide authentications or appraisals to third parties. Instead, we suggest that you contact one of the following professional organizations. They can assist with questions about value, provenance, or attribution of works of art. Foundations and catalogue raisonné committees focusing on specific artists may also offer authentications.

LONG-TERM INSTALLATION
Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, 4th Floor
"
https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/about,Brooklyn Museum: About,,,"About
The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art is an exhibition and education environment dedicated to feminist art—its past, present, and future. Among the most ambitious, influential, and enduring artistic movements to emerge in the late twentieth century, feminist art has played a leading role in the art world over the last forty years. Dramatically expanding the definition of art to be more inclusive in all areas, from subject matter to media, feminist art reintroduced the articulation of socially relevant issues after an era of aesthetic “formalism,” while pioneering the use of performance and audiovisual media within a fine art idiom.
The Center’s mission is to raise awareness of feminism’s cultural contributions, to educate new generations about the meaning of feminist art, and to maintain a dynamic and welcoming learning environment.
The Center’s 8,300-square-foot space encompasses a gallery devoted to The Dinner Party (1974–79) by Judy Chicago, a biographical gallery to present exhibitions highlighting the women represented in The Dinner Party, a gallery space for a regular exhibition schedule of feminist art, a computerized study area, and additional space for the presentation of related public and educational programs.
The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art was established through the generosity of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Foundation.

I do not think of myself as a benefactor. I am a public historian, social and arts activist, and American Indian advocate and as such have found myself being conscious of the world around me and taking action in many ways. I have been called a social artist, my actions in the public sphere being guided by the work itself. In that way—just as when I established the American Indian Ritual Object Repatriation Foundation in 1992 and as I continue to lecture and write on ethics and morality in the art market and beyond—I found the image of a place, a center, whose primary mission was to further equality, justice, and equity and provide opportunity for those moral principles and values of Feminism to be a mighty and highly desirable prospect.
Coming of age in the 1960s, my life was centered in protests of the Civil Rights Movement. That I eluded arrest or worse was a relief to my parents, but it was during those years the social activism in my marrow was ignited and shaped my actions and activities for more than five decades. Ultimately, financial resources have enabled me to create an enduring activist declaration. I am, of course, referring to the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art.
The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art is a home where the feminist principles of equality and justice reside. The Center is a forum for dialogue and discourse about feminism and feminist art. The Women’s Liberation Movement in America in the 1970s was but a beginning. We now live in a world hard-wired electronically, with each corner only nano-seconds apart from the others. But oppression, inequity, and prejudice still engulf most women in the world although, in total, women make up half the earth’s population. We will not have reached a post-feminist era until all women—women of color, disenfranchised women living in poverty and subjected to injustices, women abused or discarded—are saved from bigotry, are rescued from the horrors of rape and the sex-slave market, and at last have equal opportunities.
The Brooklyn Museum’s determined adherence to its mission to provide the fundamentals of human cultural edification is the reason why, in 2002, I shared my vision of a Center for Feminist Art with the Museum. The outstanding commitment of Director Arnold Lehman and the Board of Trustees, and the enthusiasm and hard work of the Museum’s staff, have made this groundbreaking project possible.
Watching the Center take physical form has been a thrill of a lifetime. Knowing that it highlights women’s contributions in all fields throughout history, brings feminist art to a major cultural institution, and creates a fertile space for feminists, artists, thinkers, and writers to congregate and share ideas and ideals turns a vision into reality.

https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/about/elizabeth_sackler,About the Benefactor,,,"About the Benefactor
Elizabeth A. Sackler is a public historian, social activist, and American Indian advocate. Dr. Sackler is the CEO and President of the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation, founder and president of the American Indian Ritual Object Repatriation Foundation, and sits on the National Advisory Board of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C., and on the Board of Trustees of the Brooklyn Museum, New York City.
Dr. Sackler lectures at universities and colleges in Manhattan, most recently at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the Stern School of Business at New York University. As a panelist for ArtTable at the National Museum of the American Indian, NYC, “Understanding the Current Art and Cultural Property Debate and its Impact on the Art World” and at the Vera List Center for Arts and Politics, “Cultural Genocide and Hegemony: Keys to Political, Economic, Religious, and Cultural Domination,” Dr. Sackler addressed historic and current cultural genocide and the legal, ethical, and moral debates raging in the museum and art-market worlds. She has authored numerous articles for scholarly journals and national magazines; her paper “Calling for a Code of Ethics in the Indian Art Market” is in the recently published anthology Ethics and the Visual Arts (Eds. Levin/King, New York: Allworth Press, 2006). She is a regular guest lecturer at the New York University Gallatin School of Individualized Study Graduate Seminar Program.
As President of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Foundation, Dr. Sackler was responsible for giving Judy Chicago’s iconic feminist masterpiece, The Dinner Party, to the Brooklyn Museum in 2002, and for its permanent installation venue in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum, opening March 23, 2007. Through this endeavor, Dr. Sackler has realized her vision to highlight women’s contributions in all fields throughout history, bring feminist art to New York’s major cultural institution, and create a fertile space for feminists, artists, thinkers, and writers to congregate and share ideas and ideals.
Dr. Sackler was honored in 1999 by the Yurok Tribal Council, received the Brooklyn Museum Community Committee Women in the Arts Award in 2002, was one of Women’s eNews “21 leaders of the 21st Century” in 2003, was the recipient of the President’s Award from the Women’s Caucus for Art in 2004, was named “Native American of the Year” by Drums Along the Hudson in 2005, and in April 2006 received ArtTable’s prestigious 2006 Distinguished Service to the Visual Arts.

BAK’A,ISRAEL
Andi LaVine Arnovitz was born in 1959 in Kansas City, Missouri. She graduated with a BFA from Washington University in St. Louis. For many years, Andi worked in advertising as an art director, creating print campaigns and television commercials. She attributes the conceptual ideas behind many of her pieces to this work experience. Andi considers herself a printmaker, a paper-manipulator, a bookmaker and an assemblage artist. Her primary love is working with paper, printing on it, etching with it, drawing, sewing, tearing and repairing. Her pieces often reflect her love of pattern, surface, and thread she has had since she was child wandering through her father’s fabric store in Kansas City. In 1999 Andi and her family moved to Jerusalem, Israel. A two year sabbatical has become a permanent stay and much of her work is informed by the multitudinous differences of living in the Middle East. Of great concern to her are primary issues surrounding the differences between Jews and Arabs, between religious and non-religious, between Jewish law and contemporary society, between men and women, between young and old. Over and over these politics and tensions are explored, examined and dissected in her works. Andi has had numerous solo shows in Jerusalem, and recently one at Brandeis University, and at Yeshiva University Museum in NYC. Her work has been included in many group shows all over the world: in France, Spain, England, Poland, Canada, Israel, the United States, Lithuania, and Finland.
Feminist Artist Statement
I think that by virtue of the fact that I am a woman, a wife, and a mother, my work is feminine, therefore feminist. How could it be otherwise? Because I am observantly Jewish, I find myself living with a consistent tension between what was, what is, and what could be. My art reflects this ongoing dialogue with what it means to be a Jewish woman, what it means to be a mother of daughters, what it means to be a middle-aged woman. I am continually exploring the politics, myths, and challenges of the woman within Judaism, as well as the cultural and political expectations of what a woman is in the 21st century. I use many art forms that have been traditionally relegated to the realm of women: thread, needle, decoration. I use them to create awareness, protest, dialogue, and disapproval.

Arahmaiani participated in the Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art, Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane, Australia, in 1996; the Bienal de La Habana, Havana, Cuba, in 1997; the Biennale d’Art Contemporain de Lyon, France, and Werkleitz Biennale, Germany, in 2000; the Sao Paulo Bienal, Brazil, the Kwangju Biennale, South Korea, in 2002; and the Venice Biennale in 2003. She currently lives and works in Jakarta and Bandung.
Feminist Artist Statement
To be a feminist means one must face formidable challenges from the conservatives and the fundamentalists. Conflict happens because the religious conservatives and fundamentalists don’t want to loose the legitimacy of their power! And the second challenge is the impact of globalization, where the woman and her body tend to be exploited. Her body may be bought and sold in the cheap labour market. The authorities and the global economic decisions makers often stand on the side of the conservatives and the fundamentalists in their attitude towards those groups who are weak.
Arahmaiani is included in the Global Feminisms exhibition, curated by Maura Reilly and Linda Nochlin.

TORONTO,CANADA
As a young emerging artist I would be compelled to search out female artists and curators, someone who might understand the kind of work I was making and thinking about. I wanted to break away from the hierarchy of Jansen’s Art History and create my own history. I was engaged with gender and identity issues before I even knew what the term Feminist Art meant, probably before the term was actively used. I am a studio based researcher and a professor at the OCAD University in Toronto. My professorship has allowed me to mentor and encourage a full range of students, but the focus has been on emerging female students. I see my role as helping to empower them to trust their own voice.
In 2008, Astman and AGO Associate Curator, Canadian Art, Georgiana Uhlyarik, collaborated on a curatorial project for the Transformation AGO Exhibition, dealing with Joyce Wieland and early feminist practice. The show explored the early works of Suzy Lake, Lisa Steel and myself in relationship to the influence of Joyce Wieland. For non-Canadians, Wieland was the first female artist to be granted a solo exhibition at the National Gallery of Canada in 1971. She helped to bring forward feminist issues within the predominantly male art culture of the time.

Through this project, Amezkua invites artists to exhibit in the intimacy of her bedroom; they are also asked to cook a meal and to give a workshop based on the work they are showing. In 2008, she was part of the highly competitive Artist in the Marketplace program (A.I.M. 28) at The Bronx Museum of Arts. She has had solo exhibitions at The Taller Boricua in New York; John Spencer Museum in Cuernavaca, Mexico; and Sacramento State University in Sacramento, California. Amezkua has been a part of numerous group shows in the United States and in Mexico. Mentions of her work can be found in the New York Times, TimeOut NY, New York Daily News, The Bronx Beat and Craft Magazine, among others. She lives and works in New York.
Feminist Artist Statement
Inspired by traditional art forms that allow me to articulate ideas about culture, gender and notions of identity, I have adopted crochet, embroidery and comic book visual vernacular as techniques to interpret these ideas. For the last eight years, I have been interested in the Mexican adult comic’s reductive representation of women’s bodies and identity. I appropriate these images in hopes of liberating them from their pulp fiction world and to witness the new language that is generated through these appropriations. I aim to uncover and recognize the strength these women evoke from this refreshing and new visual articulation.
Over the years, I have learned to trust my process and—by articulating my ideas through needles, fabric, thread, pens and markers—I have encountered a mesmerizing language that is leading me to an expansive world of image- and form-constructing that is not limited to the portrayal of the female figure, but rather includes broader forms and concepts.

Feminist Artist Statement
I describe my work with the feminist slogan that is still pertinent today: “Personal is political.” I start from the point of view that the ideological system is following the path to “body restriction” by spying on and normalizing us by means of controlling our personal lives. I am questioning the governing power of such institutions as religion, government, society and family on our private lives. I focus my work on the concepts that are glorified, that are transformed into taboos, that are not talked about, and that have a continuum without being questioned. Daily life has been the biggest influence on my work. From this point of view the artwork becomes provocative, aggressive, erotic, risky and violent. Artwork, then, has the act of meeting the private with public space.

BROOKLYN,UNITED STATES
Cass Bird’s depiction of her subjects provides new insight into the gritty exuberance of contemporary love and life. Following her initial success in the A + C “Festival for the Emerging Photographers” (NY), Bird’s exhibition of her series “J.D.’s Lesbian Utopia” at Deitch Projects (NY) proved a sensation. Most recently, her work has been shown at Palazzo Cavour in Turin, Italy. Bird’s pictures are featured regularly in The New Yorker, Fader Magazine, New York, and The New York Times Magazine. Raised in Los Angeles, Cass Bird graduated from Smith College in 1999, moved to New York two years ago, and presently lives in Brooklyn.
Feminist Artist Statement
These photographs show, through portraits, landscapes and documentary scenes, lives that resist and create alternatives to the structures of societal norms. They illustrate the convergence of alternative lifestyles with accepted conceptions of motherhood, nurturing and family. The subjects include people who manipulate gender roles, pushing perceived boundaries of gender specification. The photographs portray the beauty and the positive existence of these individuals, their male or female origins overridden by their own will to define their gender, sexuality, and place in society.

Sackler Center for Feminist Art in relation to the layout of the Brooklyn Museum. © Polshek Partnership Architects
The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art establishes a vital new venue and focal point within the Brooklyn Museum. The design for the new Center creates a visually distinctive environment symbolic of the Museum’s commitment to creating a permanent home for showcasing feminist art and recognizing and exploring the importance of a woman’s point of view.

Axiomatic drawing of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, including the gallery for The Dinner Party, changing exhibit galleries, and a study center. © Polshek Partnership Architects
The new Center occupies 8,300 square feet on the Museum’s fourth floor. The Center includes permanent and changing exhibit galleries, a study center, and presentation space to promote dialogue and exchange about the exhibits and related issues represented in the galleries.
Spatially the plan is organized as a series of distinct yet interconnected experiences. Judy Chicago’s iconic work, The Dinner Party, is the centerpiece of the overall design and is integrally related to the other spaces within the new Center. The primary entrance to the Center is located directly adjacent to the northwest overlook to the Beaux-Arts Court. The sequence begins through a large portal with double glass doors and signage announcing the Center in the transom above.

The overall design is conceived of as a series of concentric layers: the perimeter walls of the nineteenth-century building, the enveloping zone of changing exhibit galleries, and the walls and inner sanctum of The Dinner Party gallery. This strategy serves to reconcile the scale and triangular geometry of The Dinner Party within the rectilinear geometry of the Museum’s existing historic structure. A dramatic sculptural threshold immediately inside the entry portal signals the visitor’s arrival to the new Center. Defined by the large canting walls and glass membrane of The Dinner Party gallery, this point of arrival permits the visitor anticipatory glimpses of the piece within. Changing exhibit galleries flank all three sides of the central gallery. A small vertical window in the perimeter wall of one of the new galleries provides access to filtered daylight and a visual point of orientation by framing a view of one of the columns of the Museum’s portico along Eastern Parkway.

The permanent installation of The Dinner Party begins with a linear gallery along the outer edge of the space adjacent to the entry. This space exhibits the Entry Banners, a series of 6 Aubusson tapestries hung perpendicular to a vivid red wall. Light from overhead fixtures illuminates the Entry Banners, which appear to float within the space. The Dinner Party gallery follows, which the visitor accesses through an aperture at the apex of the triangular space. The sculptural and material qualities of this space contrast with the enveloping ring of flexible “white box” galleries. The Dinner Party gallery’s design reinforces the artist’s intention to “elevate female achievement in Western history to a heroic scale traditionally reserved for men” by actively engaging viewers with the piece and heightening their understanding of its significance (See www.judychicago.com). The sloped walls of the gallery are lined with large glass tablets that subtly reflect the space and viewers. These tablets enhance the expansiveness of the space and symbolize the ubiquitous influence and timelessness of the “guests,” while accentuating the viewer’s relationship to them. A counter-clockwise sequence along the perimeter of the table permits close-up viewing of the work’s thirty-nine place settings, each celebrating a significant woman in history. A metal lighting armature extends over the visitor’s path from the surrounding walls to define the circulation zone and accent each individual place setting. Carefully focused light illuminates the intricate details of each place setting, as well as the luminous quality of the ceramic tile base.

Immediately outside the central gallery, a flexible exhibit gallery presents biographical material about the individuals included in The Dinner Party. Permanently displayed along one edge of this gallery are the Heritage Panels, which document the research for the piece, done by the artist and her team. The panels are mounted vertically and are supported by a series of slender columns, elevating them above the floor and separating the space from the Entry Banners. An angled horizontal visor suspended from these columns caps the panel and provides an indirect light source illuminating the panels below. At each end, a vertical panel terminates the composition and supports a flat screen monitor, which provides additional information about the artwork and biographies of The Dinner Party guests. Adjacent to this gallery is the study center and presentation space. A simple rectangular room, this space has a large pivoting wall that transforms the space from an academic forum into a multimedia gallery as required for ongoing programs. Along one wall is a self-directed study center that features both printed and multimedia materials.
In addition to the technical and architectural challenges presented by an intervention within a nineteenth-century structure, curatorial and conservation requirements for the permanent installation of a fragile artwork had to be addressed. Exterior wall upgrades were designed and contemporary mechanical systems introduced to ensure a stable and comfortable environment. An intelligent lighting control system has been integrated to minimize the work’s exposure to light when the galleries are unoccupied.

This overall ensemble of spaces creates a much-anticipated new Center for exhibiting the work of international feminist artists and a forum for an active and ongoing dialogue.

Susan Rodriguez is a Design Partner in Polshek Partnership Architects, an internationally acclaimed architecture firm located in New York City. The majority of the firm’s work is for not-for-profit educational, cultural, scientific, and governmental institutions. Projects have received numerous awards for design excellence, including twelve AIA Honor Awards. The firm was awarded the President’s Medal of the New York Chapter AIA in 2003, and in 2004, received the Smithsonian Institution Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award for Architecture.
Ms. Rodriguez has designed buildings and environments that convey her passionate belief both in architecture as an interpretive medium and in its profound ability to communicate the values of contemporary society. Insights and investigation into the unique circumstances and characteristics of a project—physical, programmatic, environmental, historical, political and cultural—provide a point of departure for her development of a profound architectural commentary. Combining a keen sense of materials and color with inventive detailing to activate powerful formmaking, she creates a distinct architectural expression for each project that corresponds to its unique identity and mission. Fundamental to her design process are the importance of the human condition, and following from this, the formative influence of program on the definition of a dynamic three-dimensional framework for human interaction.
Her work ranges in scale and type—from renovations of intimate existing spaces to new large-scale independent structures—all of which focus upon the essential integration of exterior and interior space and the vital unity of site and program. Through this emphasis on the indivisibility of building and site—whether rural landscape or dense urban context—she seeks to create an architecture that is fused with its surroundings and is driven by the logic of the program. An extraordinary level of detail resolution, the inventive integration of natural light, and the exploration of innovative materials, technologies, and systems characterize all her work. Underscoring the significance of the environment and architecture’s role in its preservation, her designs are models for the application of sustainable design strategies.
In addition to the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, her recent work for cultural institutions include the Asheville Museum of Art Expansion, the Drue Heinz Center for Prints and Drawings at the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, the National Museum of the American Indian Cultural Resources Center, and the Mashantucket Pequot Museum. Education projects are also a significant focus of her work, including the Heimbold Center for Visual Arts at Sarah Lawrence College, Bard Graduate Center for the Decorative Arts Academic Building, Lycée Français de New York, and Frank Sinatra High School for the Arts. Among her institutional projects is the U.S. Courthouse in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the New York State Supreme Courthouse on Staten Island, and the recently opened Pfizer Plant Research Laboratory at The New York Botanical Garden.
In her leadership role as a design partner in Polshek Partnership, she sets design direction for the firm and participates in its management. She is a committed advocate for her clients, representing the architectural expression of their missions before public regulatory agencies, shepherding designs through the public approvals processes, and building enthusiastic consensus among various constituencies.
As an extension of her professional work, Ms. Rodriguez is actively involved in promoting the importance of design in the public realm. To this end, she serves on the Executive Committee of the Van Alen Institute as Second Vice President and on the Executive Committee of the Architectural League as Vice President for Architecture. In the academic realm, Ms. Rodriguez participates as a design juror at colleges and universities, has taught numerous studios at Cornell University, City College, and Columbia University and serves on the Dean’s Advisory Council of the Cornell University College of Architecture, Art and Planning. She is also a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.
Ms. Rodriguez received a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell University College of Architecture, Art and Planning and a Master’s degree in Architecture and Building Design from the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation. She joined Polshek Partnership in 1985.

Rachel Carey, Clara Bingham, Elizabeth Sackler
Journalist Clara Bingham and director Rachel Carey will discuss the dangers of today’s new abortion restrictions and how history might be on the brink of repeating itself. Bingham will speak about her recent Vanity Fair exposé about the secret underground abortion network code-named Jane, operated by renegade feminists in Chicago before the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973. Carey is the director of the 2019 film, Ask for Jane, the first narrative feature telling the intimate story of how a network of women students at the University of Chicago assisted 11,000 women from 1969 to 1973. Elizabeth Sackler introduces the program.

We are proud to offer a variety of virtual programs and partnerships for community organizations, libraries, and educators who host adult literacy and language-learning programs, and for speakers of languages other than English. All programs are free unless otherwise noted. NOTE: Because of COVID-19, we are currently only offering virtual visits and partnerships.
Practice Your Language SkillsWe Speak ArtJoin fellow English language learners and practice your conversational English skills with a discussion inspired by a work of art. All levels of English proficiency are welcome.
Hablemos de ArteÚnase a nosotros para una conversación informal inspirada en una obra de arte y practique su Español mientras intercambia ideas con otros participantes. Todos los niveles de dominio del español son bienvenidos.
For Adult-Literacy ProvidersOur opportunities for adult-literacy providers are geared toward supporting your adult learners, whether in an ESOL, Adult Basic Education (ABE), pre-High School Equivalency (pre-HSE), or High School Equivalency (HSE) class. Discover new connections across disciplines and deepen student engagement with your curricula through object-based teaching. Close-reading and analysis of artworks promotes skills needed by adult-literacy students, including persuasive language, deductive reasoning, and the acquisition of descriptive and metaphorical language. Some of the institutions we’ve partnered with include the Brooklyn Public Library, Literacy Assistance Center, and NYU Langone.
Single-class visits can be tailored to your specific class topics and goals, providing a forum for students to be introduced to a new idea, apply concepts that they have already started to master, or develop new skills through facilitated dialogue. Alternatively, partnerships that incorporate Museum resources throughout the semester allow for in-depth and sustained engagement that can support longer term goals. To arrange a visit with your ABE, pre-HSE, HSE, or ESOL class, or to start planning a partnership program, please fill out our form. Or feel free to contact us at adult.learning@brooklynmuseum.org.

Last Updated: August 25, 2015Welcome to the Brooklyn Museum (the “Museum”). The Museum provides the Services (as defined below) in support of its mission to act as a bridge between the rich artistic heritage of world cultures, as embodied in its collections, and the unique experience of each visitor. Dedicated to the primacy of the visitor experience, committed to excellence in every aspect of its collections and programs, and drawing on both new and traditional tools of communication, interpretation, and presentation, the Museum aims to serve its diverse public as a dynamic, innovative, and welcoming center for learning through the visual arts.By using and accessing the Services, users agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (“Agreement”), which apply to (a) www.BrooklynMuseum.org and all corresponding subdomains, web pages, and websites associated with the foregoing URL (the “Site”), (b) any mobile, web, console, desktop, and other applications provided by or on behalf of the Museum, which may be made available on the iOS, Android, and/or other operating systems and platforms (collectively, “Apps”), and (c) any other content, applications, systems, features, functionality, software, information, products, and services offered by us, including, without limitation, application/device-based features and related technology (collectively (i.e., the subsections (a), (b) and (c) above), the “Services”). This Agreement applies whether you are accessing the Services via a personal computer, a wireless or mobile device, or any other technology or device (each, a “Device”).1. Term. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your use of the Services at any time, for any reason, and the Museum may terminate your use of the Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation.2. Modifications. We may modify this Agreement from time to time, and at any time, without notice to you, for any reason, in our sole discretion. We recommend that you check back frequently and review this Agreement regularly so you are aware of the most current rights and obligations that apply to you.3. Compliance. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that (a) you are 13 years of age or older and reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions (the “U.S.”) and acknowledge and agree that features, activities, and other aspects of the Services may be subject to heightened age and/or other eligibility requirements (e.g., purchases, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, interactive initiatives, etc.); and (b) your use of the Services does not violate any applicable law, rule, or regulation.4. User Registration. In order to access and use the Services, we may require that you register for the applicable Services and have a unique username and password combination (“User Credentials”) and provide certain additional information, which may include, without limitation, your email address, legal name, date of birth, country of residence, zip code, mobile phone number, etc., and, for fee-based transactions and purchases (e.g., subscriptions, one-time purchases, add-ons, additional features, upgrades, games, etc.) offered by us, your physical address, telephone number(s), applicable payment data and information (e.g., credit card/debit card number and expiration date), etc. (collectively, a “User Account”). You represent and warrant that all registration and account information you submit is truthful and accurate and you shall maintain and promptly update the accuracy of such information. You may only have one User Account and are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your User Credentials, and you shall be responsible and liable for any access to or use of the Services by you or any person or entity using your User Credentials or Device, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you or on your behalf, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent, including, without limitation, any fee-based transactions. It is therefore critical that you do not share your User Credentials with anyone.5. Personal Information. We respect your privacy and the use and protection of your personally identifiable information. In the course of your use of the Services, you may be required to provide certain personal or personalized information to us (such information referred to hereinafter as “Personal Information”). Our information collection and use policies with respect to the privacy of such Personal Information are set forth in the Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the accuracy and content of Personal Information.6. Third Party Platforms. Some of the Services (e.g., Apps, etc.) may be dependent on and/or interoperate with third-party owned and/or operated platforms and services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, Yahoo!, Google+, PayPal, etc.) (each, a “Third Party Platform”) and may require that you be a registered member of such Third Party Platforms and provide certain account credentials and other information in order to access such Services. Such Third Party Platforms, in addition to providing application hosting, content distribution, support, and other related services, may provide us with certain additional information about you, which may include, without limitation, your email address, legal name, country of residence, location, date of birth, handles/user names, posts, preferences, friends, and usage data, all as more fully described herein and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy.7.

In order to make Located Content available to you, the Services will determine your location using one or more points of data, reference, and/or information associated with, among other things, your Device, including, without limitation, GPS, beacons, device software/features/services and other points of data, reference and information. If you have set your Device to disable GPS, Bluetooth, WiFi, or other location determining or assisting software, features, or services, or do not authorize the Services to access your location data, the Services may not be able to determine your location and you may not be able to access, view and/or receive Located Content.8. Disclosure of User Status and Activity Information. In order to access and use the Services, you expressly acknowledge, understand, and agree that the Services will automatically store, host, share, post, disseminate, disclose, and/or publish certain information concerning your user profile (e.g., name, avatar/image, etc.) and your corresponding use of the Services and related conduct, information, and activities associated therewith (e.g., content and text postings, questions regarding exhibits and artwork, feedback, ratings, etc.) in connection with the Services (collectively, “Status and Activity Information”).

Accordingly, you expressly acknowledge, understand, and agree that (a) all Status and Activity Information is public and may be globally viewed by any third parties and (b) you have no expectation of privacy in any Status and Activity Information and (c) no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is created between you and the Museum by reason of your Status and Activity Information being made public. We may, from time to time, make certain settings available to limit the sharing, availability, or public nature of certain specific Status and Activity Information, and if we do elect to do so and you properly designate your preferences using such settings, then we will honor the choices you make about who can see certain specific Status and Activity Information after a reasonable period of time to implement such preference. For purposes of clarity, the term “User Posting” (as defined herein) shall include Status and Activity Information.9. Proprietary Rights.9.1 Ownership. As between you and the Museum, the Museum owns, solely and exclusively, all right, title, and interest in and to the Services and all content (other than your User Postings (as defined herein)) contained and/or made available on, through, or in connection therewith (“Content”), and all such Content is protected, without limitation, under U.S. Federal and State, as well as applicable foreign laws, rules, regulations, and treaties. The term “Content” includes, without limitation, all audio/visual content, artwork, photographs, illustrations, graphics, logos, copy, text, computer code, software, music (including the musical compositions therein), data, user interfaces, visual interfaces, information, materials, and all copyrightable or otherwise legally protectable elements of the Services, including, without limitation, the design, selection, sequence, look and feel, and arrangement of the Services, and any copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade dress, patent rights, database rights, and/or other intellectual property and/or proprietary rights therein (including with respect to any content contained and/or made available in any advertisements or information presented to you via the Services). Unless the context clearly requires otherwise or we explicitly set forth in writing, the term “Services” includes “Content” as well.
